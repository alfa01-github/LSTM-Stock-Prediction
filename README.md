# LSTM-Stock-Prediction
This project utilizes LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks to predict stock prices. It trains on historical stock price data and provides predictions for future price movements. The goal is to assist in making informed investment decisions.

# Description
This project implements a deep learning model using TensorFlow and Keras to forecast stock prices based on historical data. It preprocesses the data, scales the features, and splits it into training and testing sets. The LSTM model is trained on the training set and evaluated on the test set. The predicted and actual stock prices are visualized using matplotlib and plotly.
